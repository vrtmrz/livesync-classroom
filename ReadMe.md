# LiveSync classroom
![screenshot](./images/livesync-classroom-capture.gif)

## What is this?

This is the custom replicator of Self-hosted LiveSync's remote vault to share Obsidian's vault or backup.

It can synchronize documents between vaults,
having different structures and different passphrases.

And, you can synchronize documents under the specified folder,
to another vault's specified one.

Of course, ~~bi-~~ multi-directional!

# Configuration

The configuration file consists of the following structure.

```jsonc
{
    // "config_1" is just the name for identifying the connection.
    "config_1": {
        // "private" and "shared" don't mean which is primary or not.
        // They are even. But I made so many misconfigurations while debugging
        // with the names "database_a" and "database_b",
        // so it was just named as like this.
        "private": { 
            "uri": "http://localhost:5984/private1_vault",
            "auth": {
                "username": "username_of_private_vault",
                "password": "password_of_private_vault",
                "passphrase": "passphrase_of_private_vault"
            },
            "path": "shared/" // Shared folder
        },
        "shared": {
            "uri": "http://localhost:5984/shared_vault",
            "auth": {
                "username": "username_of_shared_vault",
                "password": "password_of_shared_vault",
                "passphrase": "passphrase_of_shared_vault"
            },
            "path": ""
        },
        // If "export" is defined, all shared files would be saved to real files.
        // After files are exported, the processor will be executed.
        "export": {
            "path": "./export",
            "processor": "utils/build.sh"
        }
    },
    // You can set up multiple vault syncing.
    "config_2": {
        "private": {
            "uri": "http://localhost:5984/private2_vault",
            "auth": {
                "username": "username_of_private_vault",

            "auth": {
                "username": "username_of_shared_vault",
                "password": "password_of_shared_vault",
                "passphrase": "passphrase_of_shared_vault"

## Realistic example

| name                       | database_uri                              | CouchDB username | CouchDB password | vault E2EE passphrase | sharing path |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| private vault of Cornbread | http://localhost:5984/classroom_cornbread | cornbread        | tackle           | glucose               | shared/      |
| shared vault               | http://localhost:5984/classroom_shared    | common_user      | resu_nommoc      | cocoa                 |              |
| private vault of Vanilla   | http://localhost:5984/classroom_vanilla   | vanilla          | liberty          | smock                 | kyouyuu/     |

Cornbread's every document under "shared" synchronized with top of the shared vault:

| Cornbread          | shared            |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| document1          | *Not transferred* |
| document2          | *Not transferred* |
| shared/shared_doc1 | shared_doc1       |
| shared/sub/sub_doc | sub/sub_doc       |

Vanilla's every document under "kyouyuu" synchronized with top of the shared vault:

| Vanilla                  | shared            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| documentA                | *Not transferred* |
| documentB                | *Not transferred* |
| kyouyuu/some_doc         | some_doc          |
| kyouyuu/sub/some_sub_doc | sub/some_sub_doc  |

Totally synchronized like this:

| Cornbread               | shared            | Vanilla                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| document1               | *Not transferred* |                          |
| document2               | *Not transferred* |                          |
|                         | *Not transferred* | documentA                |
|                         | *Not transferred* | documentB                |
| shared/shared_doc1      | shared_doc1       | kyouyuu/shared_doc1      |
| shared/some_doc         | some_doc          | kyouyuu/some_doc         |
| shared/sub/some_sub_doc | sub/some_sub_doc  | kyouyuu/sub/some_sub_doc |
| shared/sub/sub_doc      | sub/sub_doc       | kyouyuu/sub/sub_doc      |

... with the configuration below:

```json
{
    "cornbread_to_shared": {
        "private": {
            "uri": "http://localhost:5984/classroom_cornbread",
            "auth": {

            },
            "path": "shared/"
        },
        "shared": {

        },
        "shared": {
            "uri": "http://localhost:5984/classroom_shared",
            "auth": {
                "username": "common_user",
                "password": "resu_nommoc",
                "passphrase": "cocoa"
            },
            "path": ""
        }
    }
}
```

## What is "export" for

You can run [obsdconv](https://github.com/qawatake/obsdconv), [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and any other commands that you need automatically when the vault has been updated.
So you can share documents to the people that hasn't Obsidian immediately using live-server as you like.
